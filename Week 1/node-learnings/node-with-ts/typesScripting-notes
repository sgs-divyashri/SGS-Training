TypeScript:
Similar to JS
TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.
TypeScript being a Syntactic Superset means it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.
A common way to use TypeScript is to use the official TypeScript compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.
Advanced concepts in TypeScript
 - Strong Typing (including data types)
 - Object-oriented features
 - Compile time errors
TypeScript code -> Converts into -> JavaScript code

Installing TypeScript:
cmd > cd file location > npm install -g typescript

Create a .ts file -> write down the code -> cmd -> cd file location -> tsc file_name.ts (to convert .ts into .js) -> run node file_name.js to execute the .js file

Or npx tsx interfaces.ts - for compiling and run use tis cmd
